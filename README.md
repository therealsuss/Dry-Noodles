DryNoodles
A 2025 experimental falling-sand simulation developed by a research collective.
Overview
DryNoodles is a particle-based simulation environment released in 2025 by a group of scientists known as the Noodlers. They've decided to publish an insanely complex simulation into the world and then… just walk away. The project is fully public and completely fine to alter.
